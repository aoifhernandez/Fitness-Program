									<h2><a href="#">Reach Your<br />
									Full Pontential</a></h2>
									<p>Are you a retired athlete looking to maintain or regain your fitness? An employee struggling to incorporate wellness into your busy schedule? Someone unsure where to begin your health journey and seeking guidance? A parent whose "me time" for exercise always falls to the bottom of the priority list? Or perhaps you want to improve your overall well-being? I'm here to help.
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/Marathon12.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Finding time and energy for wellness can be challenging. Who wants to wake up at 5 AM for a workout when a full day of work awaits? Or go for a run after caring for energetic kids? Reconnecting with fitness after retiring from a sports career (where you might have gone pro if not for “that” injury). Committing to healthy eating when you can just start tomorrow?
								</p>
								<p>The truth is, there are countless reasons not to pursue your wellness goals. It can be uncomfortable, challenging, and time-consuming. Yet, nothing feels worse than promising yourself to improve your health and not following through.
